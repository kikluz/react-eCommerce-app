## Better Comments
The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.
With this extension, you will be able to categorise your annotations into:

-Alerts
-Queries
-TODOs
-Highlights
-Commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there
-Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings
